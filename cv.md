## Summary

I have been studying the field of programming for a relatively long time and tried to write in different languages, used different libraries, found interesting options, but I stopped at *web development* because it seemed to me the most fascinating. I have already completed one course, tried to make up websites. Now I want to go further and master the **server** part.
